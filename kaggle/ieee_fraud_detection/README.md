## Etiquitte
- Now that we're a team, please do not share anything on the forums without discussing with all members on Slack.
- Please be sure to check [submission schedule](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1S3I9uhLb0SODCDgcUenjVbEKI4mU5WOA3B1s_YDG8PE/edit#gid=0) before submitting!
- Also date a copy of your submitted .csv and generating notebook, so that others can refer back to it in the future. Once you have your LB score, label the notebook with that too, e.g. `0.9999LB_2019-08-28_yourname.ipynb` and `0.9999LB_2019-08-28_yourname.csv`.
- As you engineer new features, please add them along with a description onto the [data dictionary](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WG8ebNLh0bAEJGzVzRByupPBp4CKQN9QTXnmDQS4DWE/edit#gid=0).
